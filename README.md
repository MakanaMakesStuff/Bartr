# About Bartr 
Bartr is a barter based trading platform that utilizes intelligent technologies to connect users and enable favorable trades online. 

# How do trades work?
Lets say you decide to list an item on our platform, your item will then be matched with a user whose interest overlaps with that particular item and who has items you might be interested in as well. It's this dynamic that will increase the likeihood of succesful trades and improve what we call "favorble trades." 

# What if I don't like a trade? 
Whenever a user recieves a trade request from another user, he or she can either deny or approve the request. If the user decides that he or she does not like any of the items offered in the trade, they can simply deny the trade. 

# How does the system match items to my interest?
Our system decides what items to show a user based on the mulitiple data points listed below: - the 10 interest that the user specifies during the creation of his or her account - user interaction with items on the platform such as liking an item, sharing an item, saving an item, and etc - denying or approving trade request
